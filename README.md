SSLLWrapper
===========

SSLLWrapper stands for SSL Labs Wrapper which I believe is the first .NET wrapper developed for the new [SSL Labs' Assessment API's](https://github.com/ssllabs/ssllabs-scan/blob/master/ssllabs-api-docs.md) that allow the comsumer to test SSL servers on the public internet.

** Notes **
- SSL Labs' Assessment API's are currently still in development and are subject to change.
- The wrapper is currently still in development aswell though is in a functional beta stage.
- The wrapper will be available as NuGet package shortly.
- The wrapper does **NOT** use web scrapping like other wrappers which don't use the assesment API's.
